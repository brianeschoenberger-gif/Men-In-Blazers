# PRODUCT.md

## Product
A premium, cinematic soccer media homepage built with **Three.js (R3F) + GSAP ScrollTrigger** that blends:
- emotional storytelling (cinematic intro)
- content discovery (stories, shows)
- community (tour stops + local guides)
- conversion (newsletter / watch / listen)

## Creative Thesis
“Football is ritual, identity, and shared memory.”
The opening should feel like stepping into a stadium tunnel: dim light, drifting dust, and a slow push toward a bright pitch.

## Homepage Sections (Planned Order)
1) **Hero:** Tunnel to Pitch (pinned scroll push-in)
2) **Transition:** Crowd Energy Surge (pinned intensity ramp)
3) **Tour Stops:** US map with pins + local guides (pinned) — next milestone
4) Featured Stories (constellation-style discovery)
5) Network Wall (shows/channels)
6) Host Spotlight
7) Matchweek Timeline (pinned horizontal)
8) Community / Fan Culture
9) Closing CTA / Footer

## MVP Scope (Now)
Build Milestone 0–2 only:
- App scaffold + section architecture
- Hero tunnel push-in (pinned)
- Transition energy surge (pinned)
- Reduced-motion + mobile simplifications
- Clean handoff into next section (placeholder)

## Experience Principles
- **Hybrid rendering:** 3D for atmosphere; DOM for text/cards/UI (accessibility + SEO)
- **Motion with purpose:** scroll scrubs cinematic beats (not random effects)
- **Performance-first:** graceful fallbacks for mobile and reduced motion
- **Readable always:** text overlay must stay crisp and high contrast

## Non-Goals (for Milestone 0–2)
- CMS integration
- Live data feeds
- Full tour stop map section (starts Milestone 3)
- Complex custom shaders beyond simple fog/particles
